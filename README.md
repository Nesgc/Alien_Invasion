## Introduction

Welcome to **Alien Invasion**, a classic arcade-style game developed using **Python** and **Pygame**! In this game, players control a spaceship and attempt to shoot down waves of alien invaders before they reach the player's ship.

The game is inspired by retro classics but brings a fresh new look with Pythonâ€™s powerful Pygame library. This project is a great way to learn about game development concepts like:

- **Collision detection**
- **Object-oriented programming (OOP)**
- **Game loops** and **event handling**

## Gameplay Overview

- **Player Controls**: Use arrow keys to move the spaceship left and right, and spacebar to shoot lasers.
- **Objective**: Destroy all alien ships before they reach your position.
- **Difficulty**: As you clear levels, the aliens become faster and more challenging to defeat!

## Features

- Smooth animations and movement using **Pygame**.
- Simple yet engaging gameplay that gets progressively harder.
- Score tracking and level progression.
- Retro arcade-style graphics.

## Requirements

To play the game, you will need to install the following:

- **Python 3.x**: Download from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).
- **Pygame**: Install using the following command:

  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  ```
